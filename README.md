# KR-.NET-
Course work on .NET. The course work is devoted to programming in window mode (Windows Application). 

# Task description
Create a C # program using window mode. 
Calculate the value of the function y (x) as the argument x increases from xmin to xmax in steps of dx. 
In a loop, when the value of the argument x changes, the expression for y (x) depends on the random number q. 
If 0 <q <= 025, then the calculation is by the formula y = f1 (x). For 0.25 <q <= 1 the formula y = f2 (x). 
Display the results for each formula in separate windows. 
In case of impossibility of calculation there should be a message about it and at what data.

Also in separate windows it is necessary to deduce quantity of calculations on each formula.

Enter input using windows. 
Each window on the form must be explained its purpose. 
In addition, place a photo of the student with the last name and the group below it on the form in a separate window. 
In separate windows give formulas for functions f1 (x) and f2 (x).
